# Quantum AI Trading System

A sophisticated AI-powered perpetual futures trading system that utilizes multiple data sources and advanced machine learning techniques to make trading decisions across multiple cryptocurrencies. The system employs a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach with attention mechanisms to process various types of data and generate trading signals.

## Trading Strategies

### 1. Multi-Modal Market Analysis

The system combines multiple data sources to form a comprehensive market view:

#### Technical Analysis

- **Trend Analysis**: Uses transformers to process price action and identify trends across multiple timeframes
- **Momentum Indicators**: RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands with adaptive thresholds
- **Volume Analysis**: Volume-weighted metrics for trade confirmation
- **Cross-Asset Correlations**: Analyzes relationships between different cryptocurrencies

#### Sentiment Analysis (Planned)

- **News Impact**: Processes news articles using RoBERTa for sentiment scoring
- **Social Media**: Analyzes Twitter and other social media platforms for market sentiment
- **Market Psychology**: Measures fear/greed through various indicators

#### On-Chain Analysis (Planned)

- **Whale Tracking**: Monitors large wallet movements
- **Network Health**: Analyzes transaction volumes, active addresses, and network growth
- **Smart Contract Activity**: Monitors DeFi and other protocol usage

### 2. Risk Management

- **Dynamic Position Sizing**: Adjusts position sizes based on:
  - Market volatility
  - Account equity
  - Cross-asset correlation risk
  - Current market regime
- **Stop Loss Strategies**:
  - Volatility-adjusted stops
  - Time-based stops
  - Profit protection mechanisms

### 3. Execution Strategy

- **Smart Order Routing**:
  - Minimizes market impact
  - Considers liquidity pools
  - Adapts to market microstructure
- **Entry/Exit Optimization**:
  - Uses TWAP/VWAP for large orders
  - Implements iceberg orders when needed
  - Considers funding rates for perpetual futures
